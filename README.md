Files created:
- /mnt/data/birthday_qr/birthday.html
- (QR not generated in this environment).

How to use:
1) Option A (scan QR): Scan the file 'birthday_qr.png' with a smartphone QR scanner or camera app. Many modern phone cameras will detect the data URL and open it in the browser, showing the birthday page directly.
   - Note: Some QR scanner apps block data URLs for security. If your scanner doesn't open it, try opening the data URL manually (see Option B) or use a different QR app.

2) Option B (open locally): Transfer 'birthday.html' to your phone or open it on any browser (double-click the file on desktop). It will show the same page.

3) Option C (host online): If the QR or scanner doesn't accept the data URL (too long), upload 'birthday.html' to any static host (GitHub Pages, Netlify, Firebase Hosting, or even a Gist + htmlpreview) and make a short URL; then generate a QR that points to that hosted URL.

If QR generation failed in this environment, you can create a QR yourself using any free online QR generator and paste the data URL:
